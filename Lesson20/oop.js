  /* Programming paradigms
  OOP - Object Oriented programming
  FP - Functional programming

  OOP:  state is usually stored in objects and can be modified through methods 
  FP: state is immutable, and functions are designed to transform data rather than mutate it
  
  OOP: classes encapsulates related data and behavior
  FP: problems are broken down into smaller, composable functions that can be combined to solve larger problems.
