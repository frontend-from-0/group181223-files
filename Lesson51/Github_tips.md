# Tips for Github profile

- Have a clear name, username and a bio. Introduce yourself, your tech stack, the projects you're passionate about, and maybe a little about your personal interests. This is your chance to make a solid first impression, so consider adding a mix of professionalism and personality.

- Pin Your Best Repositories (up to six) to your profile. 
Choose projects that best showcase your skills and range, including personal projects, contributions to open-source, and anything relevant to the jobs you're targeting.

- Add Detailed Project Readmes
For each project, ensure the Readme file is thorough and well-documented. Include the project's purpose, the technologies used, how to set it up/run it, and any challenges you overcame. Screenshots or demos are a huge plus, as they visually demonstrate what you've built.

- Commit History
Active, consistent commit histories show you’re regularly working on projects. This doesn't mean you need to stress about daily commits—quality over quantity—but a healthy, consistent history suggests dedication and passion for coding.

- Personal Branding
Keep a consistent personal brand across your GitHub and professional network profiles (like LinkedIn). Use the same profile picture, bio, and include links to your professional network profiles on your GitHub Readme.

## Interview preparation
Searching for frontend developer take-home tests and assignments on GitHub can be an excellent way to practice or see examples of coding challenges. Here's a guide to finding these types of repositories:

### Search Tips
1. Use Specific Keywords
Use search queries that include terms related to take-home assignments or coding challenges. For example:
```
"frontend developer take home test" in:readme
"frontend challenge" in:name,description
"frontend assignment" in:readme
"coding test" frontend in:readme
```

Replace "frontend" with other keywords like "JavaScript", "React", "Vue", or "Next.js" to narrow your search.

2. Filter by Repository Topics
GitHub repositories often have topics or tags that describe their purpose. Use these to refine your search. For example:

Visit: https://github.com/topics
Look for tags like coding-challenge, frontend, take-home, web-development, or javascript.

Example URL:
https://github.com/search?q=frontend+take+home+test&type=repositories


3. Look at Popular Challenge Platforms
Many take-home tests are inspired by or use challenges from well-known platforms like:

- Frontend Mentor
- DevChallenges
- Codewell

Searching for repositories with references to these platforms can yield interesting examples. Try:
```
"frontend mentor" solution in:readme
"devchallenges" in:readme
```

4. Search by Project Type
Frontend take-home tests often require building specific types of projects. Use these terms:

"dashboard"
"landing page"
"e-commerce"
"form validation"
"weather app"
"task manager"

Example:
```
"task manager frontend test" in:readme
```

5. Search for Boilerplates
Many developers create reusable take-home test templates or boilerplates. Try:

```
"take home test template" frontend
"coding challenge boilerplate" frontend
```


### Explore Repositories
1. Explore GitHub Stars Focus on repositories with many stars, as they are more likely to contain polished examples or widely used challenges.

Example Search:

```
"frontend take home test" stars:>50
```

2. Filter by Language Refine your search to match specific languages or frameworks:

```
"take home test" language:JavaScript
"frontend assignment" language:TypeScript
```
3. Use GitHub Advanced Search Use GitHub’s Advanced Search to filter by stars, forks, language, and other criteria.
