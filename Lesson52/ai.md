[The email]:


### End of any prompt
[...You prompt]. Ask me 5 questions that will improve the response you will be giving me.

### Create a prompt for anything

I want you to be my prompt-creating expert. Your goal is to help me
craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by
you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following steps.
Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I
will provide you with my answer, but we will need to improve it through
continual iterations by going through the next steps:
The second thing that you’re going to do is, based on my input, you will
generate three sections: 1. Revised Prompt, 2. Suggestions, and 3.
Questions.
We will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional
information to you and updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt
section, until it’s completed.

### Learning new skills
I’m dedicating my lunch break to improving my skills in [insert your
topic]. I need you to scour the web to comprehensively research this
topic.
Your objective is to compile a distilled guide from the resources available
online - focusing on the top 20% most valuable, insightful, and practical
aspects of this topic.
Please ensure the guide is:
Contextual and Relevant:
Tailored specifically to my topic. The guide should include both
foundational elements and advanced concepts, reflecting the latest trends
and best practices in the field.

Role-Oriented and Expertly Curated:
Approach this task as an expert researcher. Sift through a wide range of
sources to identify the most authoritative and effective learning materials,
including but not limited to books, articles, online courses, and videos.

Actionable and Concise:
Structure the guide to be actionable. Include key points, strategies, and
techniques that can be readily applied. Avoid unnecessary fluff or overly
technical jargon.

Formatted for Clarity and Ease of Digestion:
Organize the guide with clear headlines, subheadlines, and bullet lists.
Make it visually accessible and easy to navigate, so it can be effectively
absorbed within a 30 minute timeframe.

Targeted for Practical Application:
Ensure that the guide is suitable for someone looking to apply these skills
in a practical, business context. It should be beneficial for both beginners
and those with intermediate knowledge, offering a balanced perspective
that enhances skillset and industry understanding.

Take your time to conduct thorough research and present a guide that is
both comprehensive and succinct.
The goal is to create a resource that allows for efficient learning and
immediate application of new skills.
