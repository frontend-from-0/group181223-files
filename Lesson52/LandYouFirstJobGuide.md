## Make Sure Your CV, LinkedIn, and GitHub Are Well Prepared

#### CV Tips
- Highlight Transferable Skills: Emphasize any design, problem-solving, or customer-facing skills from previous careers. Hiring managers know junior developers might have limited formal tech experience, so they look for soft skills like teamwork, communication, and adaptability. Make sure to express your personality!

- Show Tech Projects: Whether from a bootcamp, personal projects, or freelance gigs, list specific examples. Include bullet points describing your responsibilities, the tech stack (e.g., React, Next.js, CSS frameworks), and the outcomes or user impact.

- Keep It Concise: Limit your CV to 1–2 pages max. Avoid clutter and only include relevant experience. Tip: showcasing the projects on the second page will keep the main part of your CV cleaner while give you an opportunity to show what you've done so far.

#### LinkedIn
- Keywords and Skills: In 2025, recruiters rely heavily on automated / AI-driven screening tools. Add keywords like “Frontend Developer,” “React,” “Next.js,” “JavaScript,” “TypeScript,” "Source control", etc.

- Engage: Post about your projects, share articles on tech trends, and engage in relevant industry groups. Algorithms favor people who are active.

- Headline & Summary: Use a concise headline (“Career Switcher → Frontend Developer | React, Next.js, TypeScript”) and a summary focusing on your journey and interests.

- Network

#### GitHub
- Pin Your Best Repos: Show at least 2–3 well-documented frontend projects. Use clear commit messages and structured READMEs that explain the project’s purpose and your approach. Add screenshots from your project and a link to the published version of it to README.

- Active Contributions: Make sure to commit daily.
Contribute to open-source projects, especially if you can fix bugs or add small features. It demonstrates collaboration and coding proficiency.

Positions to Look For as a Beginner

#### What job titles to look for?
- Junior Frontend Developer: Standard title for early-career or career-switchers.
- Frontend Developer
- Web Developer
- Software Developer
- Software Engineer
- Frontend Intern / Trainee Developer: Larger organizations or tech giants in Turkey (e.g., Trendyol, Hepsiburada) and in Sweden (e.g., Spotify, Klarna) might offer structured programs.
- Frontend QA / Test Engineer: Testing frontends can be a gateway. Look for “SDET” or “QA Engineer” roles focusing on UI automation testing.
- Web Content Developer: Some mid-sized companies have titles that combine light coding with content management. Not as code-heavy, but a way in.

Look for positions asking for **up to 3 years** of experience.

#### Internship or No Internship?
Pro: Easy to get. For those with limited coding experience, an internship can provide an intense period of learning, mentorship, and networking.
Con: Internships can pay less (or sometimes not at all). In Turkey, paid internships vary widely. In Sweden, paid internships are more common but can still be below market.
Alternative: Contributing to open-source, volunteer projects, or project-based freelance gigs can provide solid experience without the intern label. This is especially useful if you can’t afford an internship salary.
