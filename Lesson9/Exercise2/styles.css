TODO:
Create a responsive navigation menu that collapses into a "hamburger" menu on screens with a width of 768 pixels or less and displays horizontally on larger screens.
1. Add a navigation menu with several list items (Home, About, Services, Contact) within the body.
2. Style the navigation menu (background color, font, etc.).
3. Style the list items to display horizontally on larger screens.
4. Add a "hamburger" menu icon (&#9776;) and hide it by default.
5. Create a media query using the "screen" media type and "max-width: 767px" media feature.
6. Inside the media query, change the list items to display vertically and hide them by default.
7. Show the "hamburger" menu icon on small screens.
8. Use :checked pseudo-class to toggle the visibility of the vertical navigation menu when the "hamburger" icon is clicked.
9. Test your webpage in a browser and adjust the browser window's width to see the navigation menu change based on screen size.
